"""GraphRAG arms: ``graph`` (parent expansion) and ``graph_concepts``.

Both reuse the identical encode + rerank + select pipeline from ``BaseRetriever``
(so the reranker is *controlled for*, not a confound). The graph then adds:

  graph           parent-paper expansion — reconstruct each selected chunk's
                  full abstract via HAS_CONTEXT traversal.
  graph_concepts  the above, plus a MeSH concept hop — pull in a few related
                  papers that share concepts with the selected papers.

Leakage is stripped: studies are labelled generically ("=== STUDY n ===") and
no question-derived title or ``final_decision`` ever reaches the prompt.
